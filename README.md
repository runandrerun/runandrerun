### Hi, I'm AndrÃ©! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a former Senior Network Engineer (6+ years of experience) turned Software Engineer (2+ years of experience). I decided to pivot and change careers when I felt that I wasn't satisfied â€“ I quit, traveled, and returned to attend a coding bootcamp. I never looked back, and I've never been happier. In fact, my only regret is that I didn't make this career change sooner. I'm currently now looking for new opportunities in which I can continue to learn and grow into a better developer. Ideally, I'd love to be in the pet tech or health space.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on bolstering my portfolio with new projects in order to sharpen my React (with Hooks) and Styled components skills
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Firebase
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on building an application to help Fantasy Football players decide on +/- matchups dependent on positions and where a defense fails
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding a gig in which I can combine my love for coding and passion for dogs or health
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about health, fitness, and/or travel stories!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: the.asantiagojr@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've fostered several dogs successfully, and I've completed several marathons and have competed in multiple powerlifting competitions

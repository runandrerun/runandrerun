### Hi, I'm AndrÃ©! ğŸ‘‹

I'm a former Senior Network Engineer (6+ years of experience) turned Software Engineer (2+ years of experience). I decided to pivot and change careers when I felt that I wasn't satisfied â€“ I quit, traveled, and returned to attend a coding bootcamp. I never looked back, and I've never been happier. In fact, my only regret is that I didn't make this career change sooner. I'm currently now looking for new opportunities in which I can continue to learn and grow into a better developer. Ideally, I'd love to be in the pet tech or health space.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building a side project with React w/ Hooks, Styled Components, and Firebase
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and Unity 
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with someone on a project!
- ğŸ¤” I'd love to transition into the pet health/tech space 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about health, fitness, and/or travel stories!
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: the.asantiagojr@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've fostered several dogs successfully, and I've completed several marathons and have competed in multiple powerlifting competitions
